# DSA in Java

This repository contains my Data Structures and Algorithms practice in Java.  
Problems are organized by topic such as Arrays, Strings, Hashing, Recursion, Trees, Graphs, Dynamic Programming, etc.  

I’ll be regularly updating this repository with solutions as I learn and practice more DSA concepts.
